## Project Overview
The Project 'Hallucinating Culture' was developed during the Hardware II Seminar in 2021.
The aim is the imagining of unbuild architecture with help of Machine Learning.
It is divided into three main branches:

#### 1. Data Collection
The first part will cover the preparation of our dataset. 
We were exploring the city of Barcelona and takind snapshots of architectural columns.

To create a kind of streamlined process we are proposing some tools for a process-pipeline:
Camera footage  -  GrabCut_Opencv with Computer Vision  -  Resize and rename with Python

Here the full process of the [Preparation of the Dataset](https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/Hallucinating-Culture/blob/main/01_DATA_COLLECTION/README.md).


#### 2. Machine Learning
This part will cover ...

Here the full process of setting up the Machine Learning with [Machine Learning Network](https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/Hallucinating-Culture/blob/main/02_MACHINE_LEARNING/README.md) with the use of StyleGAN2 in Google Colab.


#### 3. Presentation
This part will cover ...

Here the full process of the preparation for the [Hologram Screen](https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/Hallucinating-Culture/blob/main/03_PRESENTATION/README.md).

# Hallucinating-Culture
H.2 HARDWARE II SEMINAR MRAC 20/21

## Project Overview
The Project 'Hallucinating Culture' was developed during the Hardware II Seminar in 2021.
The aim is the imagining of unbuild architecture with help of Machine Learning.
It is divided into three main branches:

#### 1. Data Collection
The first part will cover the preparation of our dataset. 
We were exploring the city of Barcelona and takind snapshots of architectural columns.

To create a kind of streamlined process we are proposing some tools for a process-pipeline:
Camrea footage  -  Cutout with Computer Vision  -  Resize and rename with Python

[Here the full process](https://github.com/MRAC-IAAC/Hallucinating-Culture/blob/main/01_DATA_COLLECTION/README.md)


#### 2. Machine Learning

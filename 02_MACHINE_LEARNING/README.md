# Machine Learning

In this folder, in docs, you will find several images as results of the training network and also in src, you will find the script to run this training.

#### 2. Machine Learning

The idea of this research is to collect data of existing architectural elements within the city of Barcelona and to feed this into a Generative Adversarial Network to train an AI with our own Dataset with the aim to come up with alternative articulations.
We are using the StyleGAN2 Repository of NVIDIA Labs in cmbination with running the training in Google Colab. The cloning of the Github Repository happens inside of the Goolge Colab file into your own Google Drive.

## Exploration of the Latent Space

During the training of a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) the machine generates a so-called ‘Latent Space’. Each point in this Latent Space represents an individual image.
The only difficulty we have to visualize the Latent Space in a simple way is the fact, that we are not talking about a Space in 2D, nor in 3D. The training of our GAN creates a network with 512 dimensions. Which is not simple to visualize or even imaginable for 3-dimensional beings, like us, as humans.
But we can try to break it down and at least try to explain it in a 3D example.
Once the training was running for a while, we can start to generate images.
